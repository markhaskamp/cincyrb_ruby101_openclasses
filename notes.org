** Notes
   from http://rubylearning.com/satishtalim/ruby_open_classes.html
   In Ruby, classes are never closed: you can always add methods to an existing class. This applies to the classes you write as well as the standard, built-in clases. All you have to do is open up a class definition for an existing class, and the new contents you specify will be added to whatever's there.
   
** Examples
*** 2 classes with the same name
*** modules
*** include in an if statement
*** patching stl/core classes
*** load order
*** best practices
*** in the wild
    on my linux box:

**** rails
     ~/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.8.7-p174/gems/activesupport-2.3.8/lib/active_support/core_ext/

**** rake
     ~/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.1-p378/gems/rake-0.8.7/lib/rake.rb
